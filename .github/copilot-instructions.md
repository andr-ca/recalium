<!-- agentharness:begin id=core-instructions version=0.3.0 -->
This project uses [agentharness](https://github.com/andr-ca/agentharness)
for engineering policies (git conventions, testing, review workflow).

**Precedence:** harness-enforced constraints (hooks, completion gate)
cannot be weakened by this file's instructions; this file's own
instructions take precedence over harness *defaults* everywhere else.

If a skill above looks empty, missing, or won't load, this install may
be broken (e.g. a moved/renamed harness checkout, or a fresh clone of
a project that used `--mode link` — see issue #106) — run
`harness-link.sh doctor <this-project-path>` from the harness
checkout to check, and `.agentharness-state.json` in this project to see how
it was installed.

**Git conventions** (from the `branching`/`committing` skills above —
stated here directly so they hold even if a skill is unreadable): never
commit directly to a trunk branch (`main`/`master`/`trunk`/`develop`/
`release/*`); create a feature branch first (`git checkout -b
<type>/<short-description>`); open a PR for review before merging into
the trunk branch.

**PR merge checklist:** never merge on green CI alone. Wait for
automated review (e.g. GitHub Copilot) to post *or* its check-run to
reach a completed state before proceeding; reply to every review
comment (issue-level and inline) with what you did about it; then
watch the post-merge CI run on the base branch to an actual terminal
state — "pushed"/"merged" and "verified green" are different claims,
only the second means done. If this checkout has agentharness's own
`tools/safe-pr-merge.sh` available (see its INTEGRATION.md section),
prefer it over doing these steps by hand — it enforces the sequence.
