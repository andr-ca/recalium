**Date:** 2026-07-11
**Reviews:** [gpt5.6-sol-recommendations.md](gpt5.6-sol-recommendations.md) (27 findings, product scored 48/100)
**This document:** a response to **every** finding — assessment, decision, evidence, and next action.

Legend — Decision: ✅ Implemented · 🟡 Partially implemented · 📋 Accepted, planned (not built this pass) · 🔵 Already addressed · 💬 Nuance/counterpoint.

## Overall response

The review is rigorous and, in the large, **correct**: Recalium is a feature-rich alpha whose release-readiness claims run ahead of enforced behavior. The core P0 gaps (faithful vendor import, deletion/backup/restore safety, honest eval gating, retrieval-filter/fusion contracts, secret handling, policy enforcement, clean build, portability) are legitimate and accepted.

Most P0s are **multi-day architectural builds**, not one-pass fixes; those are accepted and planned. This pass implemented the **tractable, high-value, low-risk** subset and the regressions the review attributes to recent work. Every finding is answered below.

## Implemented this pass

- **#3** — `evals/runner.py --strict` release mode fails on any skipped/errored check (default run stays fail-open for local smoke). `b285da8`.
- **#4** — `retrieve()` now enforces `canonical_only`/`source_system`/time-range filters on the candidate set (fixes the confirmed `canonical_only` leak) and validates the mode at the boundary (invalid mode → validation error, not silent hybrid). `9d216b3`. *Not yet:* SQL-level pre-ranking filters, shared `(source_kind, source_id, chunk_id)` fusion identity, direct fact indexing — see #4 plan.
- **#5** — Wizard copy corrected to the truthful `.env`-only model (validate here, add to `.env`, restart). `6788d91`.
- **#7** — `SPAStaticFiles` serves `index.html` for unmatched non-API/non-MCP routes so deep links no longer 404 (`6788d91`); and a Node **frontend-build** stage in `backend/Dockerfile` builds the SPA in-image, so a clean checkout builds without a host `frontend/dist` (verified: `docker build --target frontend-build` produced `dist/`).
- **#8 / #17 (claims)** — Bundle doc labelled a **source-archive** bundle; quality claim narrowed (span fidelity is extraction-set only) with a small-corpus caveat. This commit.
- **#11** — MCP retrieve access audit event is now committed (verified live: an `mcp_retrieve` row persists for a fresh actor); `get_fact_links` errors use the standard envelope. `9d216b3`.
- **#13 / #14 (regressions)** — Vitest scoped to `src/` so the Playwright spec no longer breaks `pnpm test`; `pnpm-lock.yaml` updated so `--frozen-lockfile` works with `@playwright/test`. `500542f`.
- **#14 (a11y)** — Ingest tabs are now arrow-key navigable (roving tabindex + Home/End) and the upload drop zone is keyboard-operable (Tab focus + Enter/Space + visible focus ring). `IngestPage.tsx`.
- **#13 (CI)** — Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: backend (Postgres+pgvector, non-e2e suite with the 3 stale phase-5 MCP tests allow-listed, eval metric unit tests, informational ruff/mypy), frontend (typecheck + Vitest + build), and a clean-checkout **docker build** (also proves #7). Validated locally: 208 pass / 3 deselected, metrics 7 pass.
- **#15** — MIT `LICENSE` added (claimed by website/README, previously missing). `500542f`.
- **#22** — `deleted_at` populated in the archive list response so "show deleted" renders correctly. `6788d91`.
- **#12** — Metric engine hardened: greedy **one-to-one** matching (duplicate predictions are now false positives, e.g. 1 golden + 3 duplicates → precision 1/3), **missing span = failure** in span fidelity, and nDCG accepts `total_relevant` so omitted relevant docs reduce the score. Added `evals/test_metrics.py` (7 tests, all pass). *Remainder:* centralized metric IDs from config + operator validation, and keeping zero-fact conversations in the extraction denominator. A follow-up eval run showed extraction **recall flicker (58%–62.5%)** around the 60% threshold on the 4-conversation set under the honest metrics + LLM variance — concrete evidence for #3/#20 that a sealed real corpus (not this tuned fixture) is required for release claims.

## Accepted and planned (not built this pass)

Each is valid and would improve the product, but is a substantial build. Recommended sequencing follows the review's "one trustworthy loop."

- **#1 Vendor import.** Create an `import` domain with versioned ChatGPT/Claude adapters (wrapper-object, top-level-array, and `mapping` shapes), canonical conversation/turn records, ZIP streaming, preview/selection, deterministic IDs, checkpointed batches, and a per-item error ledger. Preserve the raw export; treat unknown schema versions explicitly. **Gate:** import real exports (incl. ZIP/branches/tool-calls) with exact count/role/timestamp/span assertions.
- **#2 Deletion/backup/restore.** Define deletion semantics (physical/crypto-erase after retention); exclude erased content from new backups; append-only tombstone ledger; staged restore into a separate DB with signed-manifest + schema validation, tombstone reapply, integrity check, worker quiesce, atomic cutover, rollback, and path-containment on filenames. **Gate:** secret-ingest→delete→backup→restore(pre/post)→never-retrievable + corrupted-restore rollback test.
- **#4 (remainder).** Shared retrieval-document identity for true RRF fusion; SQL-level filters; direct active-fact indexing; propagate conflict/review state; canonical priority without starvation.
- **#6 Policy enforcement.** Typed, validated `processing_mode`/`sensitivity_hint` columns; resolve an effective policy before every provider call (summarize/extract/link/embed), default to stricter, and audit decision+provider+data-class+item-ids. Capture-proxy privacy test asserting zero sensitive egress.
- **#7 (remainder).** Publish a pinned image **digest** for non-developer users and add a clean-clone CI build job (the multi-stage image build itself is now implemented).
- **#8 (full).** Versioned graph bundle: typed raw + normalized conversation/turn + derived + canonical + provenance + link + tombstone + audit records, content hashes, streaming, migrations.
- **#9 Concurrency.** Row-lock/version-token deletion↔processing serialization in one transaction; promotion accepts only fact id + confirmation, derives content/provenance server-side, verifies active status, writes immutable actor.
- **#10 Conflict/curation.** Fact-level duplicate/overlap/contradiction detection with persisted memberships/evidence; transactional queue materialization; resolutions with domain effects (keep/merge/supersede/suppress) + reindex + audit.
- **#12 Metric engine.** Max one-to-one matching; missing span = failure; keep zero-fact sources in the denominator; nDCG from full graded qrels; centralized metric IDs from config; fail on unknown/duplicate IDs and unsupported operators; table-driven/property tests. *(Matching, span fidelity, nDCG-with-qrels, and unit tests are implemented; the remainder — config-driven metric IDs, operator validation, zero-fact denominator — is planned.)*
- **#13 (remainder).** The core CI workflow exists; still to add: a Playwright/axe job, a strict-eval gate on a sealed corpus, a migration check, an MCP-contract job, and making ruff/mypy blocking once the static debt (#26) is cleared.
- **#14 (remainder).** Ingest tabs + upload are now keyboard-operable; still to do: dialog focus trap (wizard), shared provenance drawer, all search filters, real resolve interactions, and full keyboard + axe suites across every workflow.
- **#16 Traceability.** Immutable atomic requirement IDs + generated requirement→arch→test→evidence→status matrix; one status authority.
- **#17 Provenance envelope.** One immutable provenance envelope across facts/summaries/links/canonical/retrieval/export/UI/audit; edits as new versions; source viewer with span highlighting; contract test follows every returned id to active raw source.
- **#18 `memory/` subsystem.** Quarantine from release, or add `0600` short-lived creds, explicit opt-in, sensitivity screening, audit, and `resolve()`+`is_relative_to()` path containment.
- **#19 Exposed mode.** Declare unsupported in v1 unless a full profile ships (pass/validate all env, fail-fast on unsafe exposure, authenticated UI session, server-derived MCP identity, TLS/CORS/host/rate-limit).
- **#20 Eval representativeness.** Ephemeral DB per run; stratified dev + sealed holdout from consented/redacted real exports; scale/concurrency/long-context/multilingual/backup-restore benchmarks; full environment fingerprint.
- **#21 Embedding routing.** Honor `embed_provider`/`embed_model`; version embedding spaces; validate dimension/model compatibility; represent partial completion explicitly. *Nuance:* per-function **summarize/extract** routing already landed (F1/F2); embeddings remain local-only.
- **#25 Streamable-HTTP.** Decision already recorded in [ADR 0001](architecture/decisions/0001-mcp-transport.md); v1.2 spike + client/transport matrix.
- **#26 Static debt.** Make ruff/strict-mypy green; split `dispatcher.py`/retrieval into typed stages; ban broad catches except at boundaries.
- **#27 Wording.** Adopt "local custody; optional remote processing"; per-batch data-flow preview; expand threat taxonomy.

## Nuance / counterpoints

- **#23/#24 (market/business).** Accepted as documentation/product work, not code. The recommendation to pick one beachhead (MCP developers, provenance-first) is sound and should drive scope.
- **#3/#20 headline metrics.** Agreed the "5/5 / 100%" figures are development smoke signals, not release evidence; the quality-baseline doc now says so explicitly.
- **#21.** Partially pre-addressed (summarize/extract routing exists); the embedding half stands.

## Verification for this pass

- Backend: MCP + retrieval + API tests pass (19 + 29 targeted); MCP audit persistence verified live (`mcp_retrieve` row for a fresh actor).
- Frontend: `pnpm test` green (9/9) with the Playwright spec excluded; `pnpm lint` (tsc) clean.
- Eval: `runner.py --strict` present and compiles.
